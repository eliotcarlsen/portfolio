              <p>I grew up in a small town called Sonoma, California.  It's better known as Wine Country.  For me, it was a small agricultural town.  After graduating from High School I moved to a few different cities attending Junior Colleges.  Eventually, I was accepted into UC San Diego where I got my degree in Biological Anthropology.  I then moved back up to the Bay Area where I got a job in a climbing gym.  I was working in San Francisco and moved my way up in the gym industry eventually Managing two large gyms in Sunnyvale and SF.</p>
              <p>During this time I was always interested in the other industries in the area.  And a few of my friends were accomplished programmers.  I decided to take a few classes about the subject and really loved it.  I eventually decided that I wanted to learn more in depth so applied for bootcamps.</p>
