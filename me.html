              <p>I grew up in <em>Sonoma, California</em>, better known as <em>Wine Country</em> because of the many wineries in the area.  When I was growing up Sonoma was a small agricultural town.  Now it attacts thousands of tourists every year.</p>
              <p>After high school, I bounced around to a few different cities including, <strong>San Francisco, Santa Cruz</strong> and <strong>Seattle</strong>.  Eventually, I was accepted into <strong>UC San Diego</strong> where I got my degree in <em>Biological Anthropology</em>.  I then moved back up to San Francisco where I got a job in a climbing gym.  While there I moved my way up in the climbing gym industry and eventually started managing.  </p>
              <p>I was always interested in the tech industry having grown up around the Bay Area.  Many of my friends were accomplished programmers and developers.  Eventually, I decided to take a class about Python and really loved it.  It was then that I decided I wanted to learn programming more in depth.</p>
