              <p>I grew up in <em>Sonoma, California</em>, better known as Wine Country because of the many wineries in the area.  When I was growing up Sonoma was a small agricultural town.  Now it attacts thousands of tourists every year.</p>
              <p>After high school, I bounced around to a few different cities including, San Francisco, Santa Cruz and Seattle.  Eventually, I was accepted into UC San Diego where I got my degree in Biological Anthropology.  I then moved back up to San Francisco where I got a job in a climbing gym.  While there I moved my way up in the climbing gym industry and eventually started managing.  </p>
              <p>During this time I was always interested in the tech industry.  Many of my friends were accomplished programmers and developers.  Eventually, I decided to take a class about Python and really loved it.  It was then that I decided I wanted to learn programming more in depth.</p>
